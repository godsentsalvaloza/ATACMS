### What is ATACMS?
> Automated Teaching and Curriculum Management System or ATACMS in short, is an independent learning management system designed to provide learning materials without internet connection. It is designed to work on all platforms as long as it has a compatible web browser. The main objective of ATACMS is to keep the learning materials in reach since it is mostly unavailable.

### How does ATACMS work?
> ATACMS works by using the local hotpot technology. The Host with all necessary files will start a local hotspot network and the users will connect to that said network. When connected, the users will enter the specific IP address which given by the administrator to access the learning management system. As long as the user is connected, the system will be freely accessed.
